By defining a simple syntax in Vim and using brilliant folding capabilities workflowish can simulate 99% of Workflowy's features.

Main repository:  https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/workflowish

Features?

- searching (duh, it's, like, in Vim, broseph)
- deleting (as above)
- folding as a substitute for great zoom feature
- notes (just add \ in the beginning of the line to start a comment)
- vimgrep for filtering lines
- todos:
  - a todo which is not completed is a line which starts with *
  - completed todo starts with a -

Thanks to the long running tradition, workflowish files have .wofl extension.
